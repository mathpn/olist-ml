# olist-ml

Complete churn prediction Machine Learning project using the Olist public dataset. This is based on [this awesome project](https://github.com/TeoMeWhy/olist-ml-models) by [TeoCalvo](https://github.com/TeoCalvo), which was built as part of a machine learning course on Twitch.

Here, PostgreSQL was used as a database.

## Running locally

Besides the required packages and Docker, you'll need to change the MLFlow directory variable on src/env.json.
